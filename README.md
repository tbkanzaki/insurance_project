# Insurance Project

This project is an exercise to put into practice some technologies that are widely used in different projects. In addition to Docker, Rails and PostgreSQL, we will address messaging in the future with RabbitMQ for communication between internal services and GraphQL to expose public APIs in some parts of the system.
The project will consist of a REST API, a GraphQL API and a Web App to perform user authentication.
